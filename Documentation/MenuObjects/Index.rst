MENU Objects
------------

The following menu objects are used inside an
:ref:`HMENU cObject <cobj-hmenu>`.

While the cObject HMENU allows you to define the global settings of the
menu as a whole, the different menu objects from this section can be
used to define the rendering of each single menu level.
