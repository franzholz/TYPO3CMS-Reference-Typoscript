About This Manual
=================

This document is a complete reference to all objects types and properties of
TypoScript as used in frontend TypoScript templates, and not in :ref:`TSconfig <t3tsconfig:start>`.

.. seealso::

    * For explanations about the syntax of TypoScript itself,
      please refer to the
      :ref:`TypoScript Syntax <t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-start>`
      chapter in "TYPO3 Explained"

.. _version-numbers:

Version Numbers
===============

This document always refers to the latest released TYPO3 version. For older versions,
use the version selector at the bottom left of the site.

For new features TypoScript Reference includes a note in which TYPO3 version the
feature was added. If such a note is missing, the feature is part of TYPO3 since
version 7.6 at least.


.. _case-sensitivity:

Case Sensitivity
================

All names and references in TypoScript are **case sensitive!** This
is very important to notice. For example watch the words "TEXT" and "value"
in this TypoScript code::

   myObject = TEXT
   myObject.value = <strong>Some HTML code</strong>

This is not the same as ::

   myObject = text
   myObject.Value = <strong>Some HTML code</strong>

While the first will be recognized as the content object "TEXT" and
will produce the desired output, the latter will not be recognized and
will not output anything. Even if you wrote **"TEXT"** in uppercase in the
second example, it would still not work, because the property **"value"**
is misspelled.

Always remember: In this manual the case of objects **is** important.
