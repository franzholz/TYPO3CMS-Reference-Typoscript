Using and setting TypoScript
============================

TypoScript templates mainly consist of the Constants and the Setup field.
Each template can include other (static) templates, which can again
define values in their own Constants and Setup fields.

The TypoScript template configuration can be viewed and edited in the
**WEB > Template** module.
